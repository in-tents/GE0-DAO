ok my fault I wanna flesh out this idea more before asking claude.

So the idea is, I can use calculus principles to design a self-correcting society.

Maybe it's just in the smart contracts, I'm super hoping that combined with Greg, I can have enough of a butterfly effect.

at some point I even floated the idea of mapping it to astrology, that way we can show citizens the trajectory without showing the math, but does that eve nwork?
